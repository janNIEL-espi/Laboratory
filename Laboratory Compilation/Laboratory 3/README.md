# Lab 3: Basic Symbolic Computation with SymPy

This lab activity, *"Basic Symbolic Computation with SymPy"*, is designed to help students understand and apply symbolic mathematics using the SymPy library in Python. Students begin by setting up the environment and importing the core SymPy modules needed for symbolic calculations. They then perform basic symbolic operations such as combining fractions and square roots without converting them to decimals. Students define symbols like `x` and `y`, build simple algebraic equations, and use SymPy tools to simplify expressions and expand polynomials. These activities give students hands-on experience in handling algebraic expressions in code form, helping them build a strong foundation for more advanced topics in computational mathematics.
