# Lab 4: Exploring Calculus Using SymPy

The lab activity titled *"Exploring Calculus Using SymPy"* introduces students to basic calculus concepts using symbolic computation in Python. Using the SymPy library, students learn how to work with symbols and perform key calculus operations such as computing limits, finding derivatives, and generating Taylor series expansions. They also solve equations symbolically to understand mathematical relationships more deeply. A reflection section encourages students to think about what they learned, what they found interesting, and how SymPy helps connect algebra with calculus. This hands-on lab helps students build confidence in using Python for symbolic math and prepares them for more advanced topics in computational mathematics.
