# Lab 1: Computational Thinking with the Titanic Dataset

The lab activity called *"Computational Thinking with the Titanic Dataset"* for the course COSC 110 â€“ *Introduction to Computing* was created to help students learn the basics of computational thinking using a real dataset. The lab focused on the four main ideas of computational thinking: breaking problems into smaller parts (decomposition), finding patterns, simplifying complex data (abstraction), and creating step-by-step solutions (algorithm design). Students used the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, loaded it using Python and Pandas, and explored it to find missing data and understand survival rates. They also used charts to see how age affected survival chances. All steps were done in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook, and students were asked to explain their thinking as they worked. The goal was to help students get used to working with data and to try making simple predictions based on patterns they found.
